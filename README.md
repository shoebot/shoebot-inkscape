Shoebot Inkscape plugin
=======================

The Shoebot Inkscape plugin renders the output of a Shoebot script 
directly into an Inkscape document.

This script is from 2008 and was written for Inkscape 0.46 and up.
We're not sure if or how it works -- just found it in an old HD and
put it up here. Let us know if you need help or have tried it.

Installing
----------

In case you don't have a local plugins directory, make it:

    mkdir ~/.inkscape/extensions

Then put the plugin files inside:

    cp render_shoebot_script.inx render_shoebot_script.py ~/.inkscape/extensions

Running
-------

Now look for the _Render Shoebot Script_ effect inside the `Effects -> Render` menu.

Provide the path of the script you want to render, run it and the result will be placed in your document.
