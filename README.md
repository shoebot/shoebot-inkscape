Shoebot Inkscape plugin
=======================

The Shoebot Inkscape plugin renders the output of a Shoebot script 
directly into an Inkscape document.

Installing
----------

First, check your version of Inkscape. For 0.45, use the files in the 0.45/
directory. For 0.46 and up, including development versions, use the files
in the 0.46+ dir.

In case you don't have a local plugins directory, make it:

  mkdir ~/.inkscape/extensions

Then put the contents of the relevant dir inside:

(for Inkscape 0.45)
  cp ./0.45/* ~/.inkscape/extensions

(for 0.46+ and up)
  cp ./0.46+/* ~/.inkscape/extensions

Running
-------

Now look for the 'Render Shoebot Script' effect inside 'Effects->Render' menu.
Just provide the path of the script you want to render, and fire it up.
